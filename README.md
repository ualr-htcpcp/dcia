# DCIA

**D**epartment **C**ontinuous **I**mprovement **A**pplication (DCIA) is a web
application developed for coursework at the University of Arkansas at Little
Rock that tracks student outcomes across semesters and instructors.

## Application Stack

DCIA leverages a variation of the MERN stack through the following technologies:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org): JavaScript framework that packages a ReactJS driven frontend with an ExpressJS-like backend, providing support for hybrid rendering, API endpoints, and optimized bundling.
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas): Document-based database hosted in the cloud and accessed through the Mongoose client.
